You are given a very large html file, and you want to know how many different domains are linked to by the hyperlinks in that file.

= the high-precision way
Use an html parser to parse the file, and get the value of all the <a href="..."> attributes. For each url obtained this way, use a url parser to extract the domain.

drawbacks:
- what if the html is malformed? liberal html parser?
- requires writing code

= the shell way
write a regex like this:
$ grep -o "<a[^>]*href="([^"]*)" infile.html | sort -u

drawbacks:
- edge cases in valid html
    - single vs double quotes
    - weird whitespace with newlines
    - http vs https
