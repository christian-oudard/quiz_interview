You are given a very large xml file, and you want to know how many different types of "list" attributes there are in the file.

"A" solution:

Use grep and sort from memory. Time: 3 seconds.

$ grep -o "list='[^']*'" infile.xml | sort -u
list='alphalower'
list='alphaupper'
list='bullet'
list='circle'
list='number'
list='romanlower'
list='romanupper'
list='square'

"B" solution:

"Hmm, I bet there's a really neat regular expression to do that, let me check the docs."

Time: 10 minutes.


"F" solution:

"I'll write a program in java really quick to do that!" Time: 4 hours.
