Problem 1
Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 100, one number for each line. Instead of multiples of 3, the program prints "Flash". Instead of multiples of 5, the program prints "Bang". Instead of multiples of 3 and 5, it prints "FlashBang".

Example output for numbers 1 through 16:
1
2
Flash
4
Bang
Flash
7
8
Flash
Bang
11
Flash
13
14
FlashBang
16


Problem 2

Write a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a single string containing an english sentence listing the words, using correct comma rules for writing lists.

Example:
input: ["one", "two"]
output: "one and two"

input: ["one", "two", "three"]
output: "one, two, and three"


Problem 3

If you start listing out the numbers of the fibonacci sequence, you have to list out thirteen of them before you find one with three decimal digits:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

How many fibonacci numbers would you have to list to find one with at least 19 digits? Write a program to solve this problem.

Bonus: How many would you have to list to find one with at least 10,000 digits?
